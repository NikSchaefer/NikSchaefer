# 👋 hey, I'm Nik! 

I'm a software developer, entrepreneur, and Computer Engineering student at UW-Madison. My passion lies at the intersection of technology, business, and philosophy.

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

- Founder of **@Noveltor**, a mental health startup
- Running an Advertising Agency focused on helping schools reach their audience
- Managing Blue Mango Software, my consulting venture
- Pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering @UW-Madison

## 🌱 Current Focus

I'm currently diving deep into Rust, exploring its potential for building efficient and reliable systems.

## 🏊‍♂️ Beyond Coding

When I'm not immersed in code or brainstorming the next big idea:

- 🤿 Scuba diving in exotic locations
- 💪 Hitting the gym
- 📚 Reading thought-provoking books (Ask me about "The Fifth Science"!)

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects or engage in discussions about tech, business, or philosophy. Feel free to reach out!
